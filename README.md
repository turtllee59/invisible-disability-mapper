## Project Overview

I created this web application to help people with invisible disabilities make informed decisions about where to go. Traditional accessibility tools often focus on physical barriers, but sensory challenges like noise levels, lighting, and crowd density are also important to consider for many.

This project combines interactive mapping technology with user-generated accessibility reviews, specifically designed with neurodivergent-friendly UI principles in mind.

## Key Features

### Neurodivergent-Friendly Design
- **Calming color palette**: Sage green theme (#9CAF88) to reduce visual stress
- **Clear navigation**: Simple, intuitive interface with minimal cognitive load
- **Accessible typography**: Courier New font for improved readability
- **Gentle gradients**: Subtle visual elements that don't overwhelm

### Sensory Challenge Rating System
Instead of traditional accessibility ratings, I implemented **7 specialized sliders** that matter most to neurodivergent individuals:
- **Noise Level** (1-10): How loud/overwhelming the environment is
- **Lighting Quality** (1-10): Harshness vs. comfortable lighting
- **Crowd Density** (1-10): How busy/crowded the space gets
- **Sensory Overload Risk** (1-10): Overall sensory intensity
- **Social Interaction Required** (1-10): How much social engagement is expected
- **Predictability** (1-10): How routine/structured the environment is
- **Flexibility** (1-10): How accommodating staff/environment is to different needs

### Interactive Mapping
- **Real-time location search** using Geoapify API
- **Visual markers** distinguishing between places and user reviews
- **Clustered display** to prevent visual overwhelm
- **Click-to-select** locations for easy review submission

### Community-Driven Reviews
- **Location-based reviews** with detailed sensory information
- **Personal comments** section for specific tips and experiences
- **Filter system** to find reviews by location or challenge type
- **Privacy-focused** - no personal information required

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- HTML5 with semantic accessibility features
- Custom CSS with neurodivergent-friendly design principles
- JavaScript (ES6+) for interactive functionality
- Bootstrap 5 for responsive layout
- Leaflet.js for interactive mapping

**Backend:**
- Node.js with Express.js server
- RESTful API design
- JSON file storage (easily upgradeable to database)
- Environment-based configuration

**External APIs:**
- Geoapify for geocoding and place search
- OpenStreetMap for map tiles

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- A Geoapify API key ([get one free here](https://www.geoapify.com/))

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/turtllee59/invisible-disability-mapper.git
   cd invisible-disability-mapper
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env and add your Geoapify API key:
   # GEOAPIFY_KEY=your-actual-api-key-here
   ```

4. **Start the server**
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

5. **Open your browser** to `http://localhost:3000`

## How to Use

1. **Explore the map** - Default view shows College Park, MD area
2. **Search for places** - Use the sidebar to search by location and category
3. **Click to select** - Choose locations from the map or search results
4. **Submit reviews** - Rate places using our 7-point accessibility system
5. **Browse past reviews** - Filter and explore community feedback
6. **Find accessible spaces** - Use reviews to make informed decisions

## üéì Development Notes

This project was developed as part of my computer science coursework, with a focus on:
- **Inclusive design principles** for neurodivergent users
- **API integration** and real-time data handling
- **Responsive web development** best practices
- **User experience research** in accessibility space

*I received assistance from GitHub Copilot for certain coding challenges, particularly around API integration and responsive design implementation, but the core concept, accessibility focus, and user experience design were entirely my own.*

## Why This Matters

Traditional accessibility resources often overlook the needs of people with invisible disabilities. This application addresses:

- **Sensory processing differences** common in autism and ADHD
- **Social anxiety** considerations for neurodivergent individuals
- **Predictability needs** that help reduce stress and meltdowns
- **Community knowledge sharing** among people with similar challenges

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Database integration for scalability
- [ ] User accounts with personal preferences
- [ ] Mobile app development
- [ ] Integration with existing accessibility platforms
- [ ] AI-powered recommendation system
- [ ] Multilingual support
